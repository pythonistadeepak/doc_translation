# This code implements the translation of documents with .docx and .pdf formats using Streamlit, PyPDF2, deep-translator, reportlab and python-docx libraries.
# It allows users to upload a PDF or word file, extract text from it, and then translate it from ENGLISH to GERMAN without using any LLMs
# User can download the translated document using DOWNLOAD button at Streamlit interface.
